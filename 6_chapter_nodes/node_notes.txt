Create a new sanbox env for a node by running the same init as before:
kitchen init --create-gemfile
bundle install
--edit .kitchen.yml---
kitchen create default-centos65

Node == any machine (server, workstation, router, etc...) managed by Chef which
has the Chef client installed on it.

You can install the client by running the following:
kitchen setup default-centos65

You can run a recipe on the sandbox machine using the chef client, although this
isn't how you will typically do it (we'll look at how to run recipes and cookbooks
next lession w/chef converge). First, login to the sandbox, then create the recipe,
then run chef client in local mode.

In local mode, any data that would have been saved to a server is written to the
local directory. The process of writing server data locally is called writeback.

kitchen login default-centos65
--make some recipe in a .rb file--
sudo chef-client --local-mode somefile.rb
